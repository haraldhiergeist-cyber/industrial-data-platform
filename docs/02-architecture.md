# Architecture

## Overview

The Industrial Data Platform Showcase is designed as a layered cloud-native architecture that covers the complete stack from infrastructure to business applications.

The architecture follows modern platform engineering principles and separates infrastructure concerns, platform services, and business functionality into clearly defined layers.

## Application Architecture

![Dashboard](screenshots/dashboard.png)

The business application consists of multiple independent services.

### PLC Collector Service

Responsibilities:

- Connect to PLC devices using Apache PLC4X
- Read process values from industrial controllers
- Publish measurement events to Kafka
- Decouple field communication from downstream systems

### PLC Persist Service

Responsibilities:

- Consume Kafka events
- Store historical measurements in PostgreSQL
- Provide long-term persistence

### PLC Query Service

Responsibilities:

- Provide REST APIs
- Deliver current process values
- Deliver historical measurements
- Publish WebSocket updates
- Maintain current values in Redis

### Angular UI

Responsibilities:

- Real-time dashboards
- Historical trend analysis
- Authentication integration
- User interaction

## Infrastructure Architecture

![Harvester](screenshots/harvester.png)

The complete platform is hosted on a Harvester-based infrastructure.

Components:

- Physical server hardware
- Harvester virtualization platform
- Virtual machine management
- Virtual networking
- Kubernetes cluster nodes
- Platform services
- Business applications

This architecture demonstrates full-stack ownership from infrastructure to application level.

---

## Architectural Principles

The platform is based on the following principles:

- Cloud Native Architecture
- Event-Driven Communication
- Loose Coupling
- Infrastructure as Code
- GitOps Operations
- Security by Design
- Observability First
- Platform Engineering

## Summary

The Industrial Data Platform Showcase demonstrates how modern industrial applications can be implemented using cloud-native technologies while maintaining clear separation between infrastructure, platform services, and business functionality.

The architecture intentionally covers the complete technology stack to demonstrate expertise in software development, infrastructure, Kubernetes, DevOps, and industrial integration.
